This GitHub repository is intended for exploration in my capstone research. I apologize for the messy code. The actual paper can be found at the root of the director as `Capstone_Project_1__Housing_Price_Predictions_in_San_Francisco.pdf`. Please read this if you are interested in my actual project.
